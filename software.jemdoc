Sharing code for machine learning papers is hard. Most of the work is put into attaching and manipulating code. I think emphasis is put on the +machine learning framework+, where it would be better spent finding efficient means of manipulating the data (or images). Therefore, my current workflow is to add +tools+ to a large and growing github repository unfortunately named +metaDatasetGenerator+. The name is unfortunate since it neither informs the reader what capabilities the repository wields nor is the name itself cute. The name +metaDatasetGenerator+ refers to the idea that the repository generates data about the data... The primary goal of almost every statistical process.
